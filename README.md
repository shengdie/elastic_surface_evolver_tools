Tools for generating input files of elastic surfaces and reading surface evolver data (http://facstaff.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver/evolver.html)


# Surface Generator
For generate different shape of surfaces and input files for Surface Evolver.
## Any mesh
For create surface meshes of any shape, currently support annular shape only. It has some general algorithms to help generate surfaces, like distinguishing boundary edges, writing mesh according to Surface Evolver syntax etc, so it can be easily extended to generate other shapes. 

### Examples
```
./create_ring.py -ir 1 -or 20 -es 0.1 -ds "lambda p: abs(ic.dist(p))**0.5/10 + 0.06" -kw "{'max_steps': 100000}" ring1_20
```
which creates a ring with inner radius 1 and outer radius 20. And the edge size is increasing with radius in a square root order.

### Requirements
```
dmsh==0.1.10
```


## Rectangular mesh with periodic boundary conditions
For create rectangular mesh with periodic condition.

## Export data
You can export the mesh data easily by command, 
```
save_dict
```
which will save the data in json format. You can also add any other variable you want in `diagnostics.cmd`

## Smart converge 
There is a smart converge procedure `hgb`, it will automatically choose the quicker one between `hessian_seek` and `g` and run until converging to a minima.
# Surface Reader

Can read rectangular and annular surface evolver data generated by `save_dict`. It can plot surface, stress, strain, cross sections, contour etc.

## Examples
![fig](figs/surface_reader.png?raw=true "example of plotting stress")

## Requirements
```
h5py==3.7.0
```
